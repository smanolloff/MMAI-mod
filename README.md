# Overview

A [VCMI](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi) mod for distributing pre-trained
[`MMAI`](https://github.com/smanolloff/vcmi-MMAI) models through the VCMI mod

Models are trained using the [`vcmi-gym`](https://github.com/smanolloff/vcmi-gym)
project and are stored here once they become production-ready.

This repo is a submodule of https://github.com/smanolloff/vcmi.
